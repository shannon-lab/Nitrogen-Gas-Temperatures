# Nitrogen-Gas-Temperatures
The 'Kris_Gas_Fit_Test.m' is a Matlab script that uses the boxcar method for fitting N2 second positive system spectrometer data and infer gas temperature. The script was originally developed by Kristopher Ford as part of his dissertation work. His thesis is included in this repository for reference. 

A simple test case is give in the \Test folder which covers the use of the code and provides some example data for the user to become familiar with the script and it's quirks.
